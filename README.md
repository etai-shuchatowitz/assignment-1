## How to run:

To run, clone the repo and simply run the corresponding question. For most cases, this is as simple as pressing run or typing
```matlab
f = @question4;
f()
```

However, if the script takes a variable, then you have to pass in that variable. 

Not everything is a function as questions 2 and 3 are simply scripts that are run in the usual way.
